# godot3_shaders
Experiments on Godot3 shaders. Some original shaders are taken from the [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) and [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/) sites and converted in according to Godot's Shader API.
For a brief guide on how to migrate from ShaderToy to Godot 3 look here: https://github.com/jospic/godot3_shaders/tree/master/sea-water
